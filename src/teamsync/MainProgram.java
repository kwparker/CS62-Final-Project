// make hash map for valid teams and when team name is inputted, adds athlete to team or creates new team




// need to be able to escape course registration

// right now, every time you register for courses your entire academic schedule is cleared, so for example if you want to filter 
// by department csci and register for 2 courses, and then you want to filter by department again like math and register 
// for 2 more classes, for a total of 4 classes, it doesn't work since every time you register for classes your current academic
// schedule is cleared. we need an option that asks if you want to edit your schedule (which will allow to register for more courses,
// however only a max of 5, or if you want to clear your schedule and register for all of your classes at once)
